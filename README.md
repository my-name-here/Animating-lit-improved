This acts as a simple proof of concept for a novel way of viewing a poem. It highlights different parts of the poem as you scroll, bringing your attention to different words and phrasing. This highlighting could be done as different distances from the camera for parallax, but in this proof of concept, the text is just highlighted. To run, just download the files and open index.html in your browser.
