<p>
AFTER YOUR DEATH
  <br>
  <br>
</p>

<b>First, I emptied </b><p> the closets of your clothes,<br>
threw out the bowl of fruit, </p><b>bruised <br>
  from your touch</b><p>, left empty the jars<br>
<br><p>
you bought for preserves. The next morning,<br>
birds rustled the fruit trees, and later<br>
when I twisted a ripe fig loose from its stem,<br>
<br>
I found it half eaten, the other side<br>
already rotting, or — like another I plucked<br>
  and split open — </p><b>being taken from the inside</b><p>:<br>
<br>
a swarm of insects hollowing it.</p> <b>I’m too late,<br>
  again</b><p>, another </p><b>space emptied by loss.</b>
<p><br>Tomorrow, the bowl I have yet to fill.
</p>
