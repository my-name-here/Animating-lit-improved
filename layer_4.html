AFTER YOUR DEATH<br>
<br>
<br>
      First, I emptied <b>the Closets of your clothes</b>,<br>
threw out the bowl of fruit, bruised<br>
from your touch, <b>left empty the jars<br>
<br>
      you bought for preserves. The next morning,</b><br>
birds rustled the fruit trees, and later<br>
      <b>when I twisted a</b> ripe fig loose from its stem,<br>
<br>
      <b>I</b> found it half eaten, <b>the other side</b><br>
      already rotting, <b>or — </b>like another I plucked<br>
and split open — being taken from the inside:<br>
<br>
      <b>a</b> swarm of insects hollowing it. I’m too late,<br>
      again, <b>another</b> space emptied by loss.<br>
      <b>Tomorrow</b>, the bowl I have yet to fill.<br>
