AFTER YOUR DEATH<br>
  <br>
  <br>
<b>First, I emptied </b>the closets of your clothes,<br>
threw out the bowl of fruit, <b>bruised <br>
  from your touch</b>, left empty the jars<br>
<br>
you bought for preserves. The next morning,<br>
birds rustled the fruit trees, and later<br>
when I twisted a ripe fig loose from its stem,<br>
<br>
I found it half eaten, the other side<br>
already rotting, or - like another I plucked<br>
  and split open - <b>being taken from the inside</b>:<br>
<br>
a swarm of insects hollowing it.<b>I'm too late,<br>
  again</b>, another <b>space emptied by loss.</b>
<br>Tomorrow, the bowl I have yet to fill.
