In it, we see descriptions of fruit, and actions related to it, rather than talking about the person.

AFTER YOUR DEATH<br>
<br>
<br>
First, I emptied the Closets of your clothes,<br>
  <b>threw out the bowl of fruit,</b> bruised<br>
from your touch, left empty the jars<br>
<br>
you bought for preserves. The next morning,<br>
<b>birds rustled the fruit trees</b>, and later<br>
when I twisted a <b>ripe fig</b> loose from its stem,<br>
<br>
I <b>found it half eaten</b>, the other side<br>
<b>already rotting</b>, or - <b>like another I plucked<br>
and split open </b>- being taken from the inside:<br>
<br>
a <b>swarm of insects hollowing it</b>. I'm too late,<br>
again, another space emptied by loss.<br>
Tomorrow, <b>the bowl I have yet to fill.</b><br>
