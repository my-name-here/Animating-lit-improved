AFTER YOUR DEATH<br>
<br>
<br>
First, I emptied the Closets of your clothes,<br>
threw out the bowl of fruit, bruised<br>
from your touch, left empty the jars<br>
<br>
you bought for preserves. The next morning,<br>
birds rustled the fruit trees, and later<br>
when I twisted a ripe fig loose from its stem,<br>
<br>
I found it half eaten, the other side<br>
already rotting, or - like another I plucked<br>
and split open - being taken from the inside:<br>
<br>
a swarm of insects hollowing it. I'm too late,<br>
again, another space emptied by loss.<br>
Tomorrow, the bowl I have yet to fill.<br>
</p>
